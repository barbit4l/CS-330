# CS-330

For this project, I created a 3D version of a 2D image using C++ and OpenGL for a client at Triangle and Cube Studios. My approach to designing software focused on understanding user needs and keeping things simple. I improved my design skills in 3D modeling and texturing, and I followed an iterative process that allowed me to get feedback and make improvements, which Iâ€™ll use in future projects.

In terms of development, I used modular programming to keep my code organized and reusable. Iteration was key; I refined the scene based on testing and user input. This project helped me see how important clean, efficient code is for my future in fields like game development and interactive media.

Working with computational graphics has given me useful skills for both school and my future career. I learned how to create engaging graphics, which can apply to many industries, from gaming to healthcare. Overall, this experience has been valuable for my growth as a developer.
